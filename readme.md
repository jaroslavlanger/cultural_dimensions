Old Introduction
----------------

Let's start with a simple question: what is a culture?
Sir Edward Burnett Tylor, a tycoon of anthropology, defines it as "Culture . . . is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society"[Tylor 1871].
Is it reasonable to think a culture could be approximated with just a language?
Noah Chomsky considers language to be a "The Mirror of the Mind"[Chomsky 2004].
Some go even further to say, the language is a mirror to the culture [Kadarisman 2009].
Luckily we do not need to approximate culture in its eternity.
Hofstede's 6 dimensions don't do it either.
He said himself that "CULTURE DOESN’T EXIST.
In the same way values don’t exist, dimensions don’t exist.
They are constructs, which have to prove their usefulness by their ability to explain and predict behavior"[Hofstede 2002].
Let's test the following.
If the cultural dimensions of most of the countries will predict the country's language.
Then instead of testing casualties from culture to some effect, it could potentially be reduced to language to effect relation.
On top of that, according to Brown "A language is a part of a culture, and a culture is a part of a language: the two are intricately interwoven so that one cannot separate the two without losing the significance of either language or culture"[Brown 1994.].
Just to state it clearly, here, we do not test whether language causes cultural dimensions.
Rather I test whether the connection of these two is tight enough, so one can be approximate with the other.
